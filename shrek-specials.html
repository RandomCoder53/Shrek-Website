            <p>	I quite liked the Shrek Halloween special, “Scared Shrekless.” I believe it was a really faithful spinoff with good humor–something that cannot be said for the recent movies in the Shrek series. It’s a breath of fresh air to look back on these classics.

                This special follows Shrek and his friends telling spooky stories to scare each other. However, this special uses its format to explore creative and unique scenarios for the characters, which is definitely my favorite aspect of it. I especially enjoyed Puss in Boots and Donkey’s story, as the idea of both of them trying to one up each other was executed very well and there were a lot of great gags. I also liked the Gingerbread Man’s story, as it was a simple and fun plot with some creative adult humor mixed in. Additionally, the animation stays fluid and high quality throughout the entire runtime.

                There are also some problems I have with this special, most of which stemming from the restrictions of a short television special in the first place. Primarily, I find the pacing to be quite fast–especially in the Gingerbread man’s story. It felt like there were too many cuts, and the tone of the scene was changing at a rate that felt difficult to process. I also feel that more could’ve been done with Shrek’s story. While there were some funny moments and creative ideas, it was overall not very memorable and ended quite abruptly.

                I believe that “Scared Shrekless” is an amazing spinoff of the movie “Shrek” with a good plot, great humor, and amazing animation–especially for a television special. Sometimes it is important to look back at these classics, as the film industry has recently been overrun by poorly written sequels and corporate crash grabs. I recommend this special to any fan of Shrek that wants to watch a good spinoff with a fun and short story.
